				<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
				Like most website operators, mensches.net collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Mensches.net’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how mensches.net’s visitors use its website. <strong>However, mensches.net will never, under any circumstances, release this information.</strong>
				<br />
				<br />
				Mensches.net also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Mensches.net does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
				<br />
				<br />
				<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
				Certain visitors to mensches.net’s websites choose to interact with mensches.net in ways that require mensches.net to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that mensches.net gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, mensches.net collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with mensches.net. mensches.net does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
				<br />
				<br />
				<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
				Mensches.net may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. However, mensches.net does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
				<br />
				<br />
				<h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
				Mensches.net discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on mensches.net’s behalf or to provide services available at mensches.net’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Mensches.net will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, mensches.net discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information <strong>only when required to do so by law</strong>, or when mensches.net believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of mensches.net, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a mensches.net website and have supplied your email address, mensches.net may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with mensches.net and our products. However, we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. mensches.net takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

				<h3>Cookies</h3>
				A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Mensches.net does not currently use cookies to help mensches.net identify and track visitors, their usage of mensches.net website, and their website access preferences. However, we reserve the right to change that in the future if a new feature requires the use of cookies. Mensches.net visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using mensches.net’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of mensches.net’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
