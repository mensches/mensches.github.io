				<h2>About this Website</h2>
				<p>
					I created this website as a project for summer camp in August 2015. I don't know if I'll be updating it or not, but I hope you enjoy what I've created so far.

					<h1>Privacy Online</h1>
					<p>
						Bob just posted a picture of himself doing something inappropriate on Twitter at a party. Was that dumb? Yes. Will it come back and haunt him in the future? Yes. Oh, he also just applied to Harvard, Carnagie Mellon, and some more of the Ivy League schools. Yeah.... that <em>was</em> really dumb of Bob.
						<br />
						<br />
						That right there was an example of what <strong>not</strong> to do. It was also completely fictional. Bob probably wishes he never did that, but, sadly for Bob, it's going to be very hard for him to "unpost" that from the Internet. Most people are under the assumption that once you post something on the internet, it immediately goes <u>everywhere</u>. Kind of true. It immediately goes to whatever servers Twitter or Facebook has serving their content, lets say, as well as to anybody using a program to save profile data and posts, and to said social networks backup/archive servers, but after it has been flagged or reported to the social network, it becomes a lot harder for your average Joe to find that picture/post, unless a website has a backup of profile data. Anyways, you get the point.
