				<h2>About this Website</h2>
				<p>
					I created this website as a project for summer camp in August 2015. I don't know if I'll be updating it or not, but I hope you enjoy what I've created so far.

				<h2>About M2M</h2>
				<p>
					Mensch 2 Mensch is an idea I had a while ago that I realized could be combined with this website. Basically, M2M is a place where people in need of, let's say a good Mac IDE, could come here and find that other mensches.net visitors like to use <a href="https://panic.com/coda">Coda 2</a>, developed by <a href="https://panic.com">Panic</a>. People can email me (link at the bottom) websites, articles, guides, etc. that they found really useful and I will (try) to add them to the listings, along with sections that they want added.

				<h1>Great Websites</h1> 
				<h2>According to this Website's Creator</h2>

					<p>
						Lastpass is amazing for people like me because being security conscious isn't easy. Lastpass saves my brain from having to remember a different password for each website, as well as pre-filling the usernames and passwords in the webpages when I login with my "master" password, (of which I now only have to remember one) and a code from Authy (a two-factor authentication app) on my phone.

					<a href="https://j.mp/menschesk"><img src="../assets/img/m2m/kodingLogo.png" height="80px" /></a>
					<p>
						The Koding IDE is pretty amazing considering it's all web-based. This online IDE offers an extensive set of features that I use all the time, such as separate "workspaces" for each of my projects. It's great for people who use many different computers, ie. on a college campus. (Oh, and it's also free.)

					<a href="https://j.mp/menschesmailbox"><img src="../assets/img/m2m/mailboxLogoCrop.png" width="300px" /></a>
					<p>
						<br />
						Mailbox is an email app different from all the rest. It's primary (and only) goal is to get your inbox down to zero. There are different folders that you can sort email into, as well as timed reminders that are amazingly easy and convenient.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="linkright">
					<a href="https://instructables.com"><img src="../assets/img/m2m/instructablesLogoCrop.png" /></a>
					<p>
						Instructables is a community-based collection of guides, how-tos, and the like on any topic you could possibly think of. It's great for people who want to build something (whether it be physical or virtual) but who have no idea of where to start. Just see for yourself.

				<div class="linkleft">
					<a href="http://codingbat.com"><img src="../assets/img/m2m/codingBatLogo.png" height="70px" /></a>
					<p>
						CodingBat is a free site of live coding problems to build coding skill in Java and Python, created by <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/nick/">Nick Parlante</a> who is computer science lecturer at Stanford. The coding problems give immediate feedback, so it's an opportunity to practice and solidify understanding of the concepts. I used it extensively when learning Java and Python.

				<div class="linkright">
					<a href="https://mail.zoho.com"><img src="../assets/img/m2m/zohoLogo.png" height="90px" /></a>
					<p>
						Zoho Mail is great because it offers free custom domain email addresses, which is great for businesses who are just starting out. They offer IMAP, POP, and SMTP servers, so you can use your own email client to access the email, even integrating it into your Gmail account. If you send me your email, I'll email you a referral link, which will get you (and me) an extra 5 users for life.
